A Storm in the AI World
The air was thick with tension in Silicon Valley. Tech giants and AI researchers were buzzing about a seismic shift in the industry‚Äî
a new player had entered the game.
Deep in China, an AI startup named
DeepSeek
was making waves, shaking the foundations of artificial intelligence as we knew it.
Meanwhile, developers across the globe were celebrating a different kind of revolution‚Äî
Ollama
, an open-source tool that let them run large language models (LLMs) on their local machines, giving them control like never before. But as the AI battlefield heated up, one unexpected casualty emerged:
NVIDIA, the titan of AI hardware, saw its stock plummet in a historic market crash.
What was happening? And more importantly,
what was China hiding?
The NVIDIA Market Crash: A $600 Billion Shockwave
While AI enthusiasts debated
Ollama‚Äôs independence
and
DeepSeek‚Äôs hidden motives
, the stock market had its own reaction‚Äî
a violent, record-breaking crash for NVIDIA.
The company, which had
long dominated the AI chip market
, had enjoyed soaring stock prices as AI models required ever-more-powerful
GPUs (graphics processing units)
. But with DeepSeek proving that AI models
could be trained more efficiently
, and with alternative tools like Ollama reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure,
investors panicked.
üö®
On January 27, 2025, NVIDIA lost nearly $600 billion in market capitalization‚Äîthe largest single-day drop in U.S. stock market history.
üö®
This was not just about
one company‚Äôs bad day
. It signaled a
paradigm shift
‚ÄîAI was evolving beyond the
GPU-hungry
models that NVIDIA had profited from. Could this be the beginning of NVIDIA‚Äôs decline?
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãDeepSeek: China's AI Wildcard
From behind the Great Firewall, China‚Äôs DeepSeek emerged like a shadowy figure in the night.
Its AI model was powerful, efficient, and most importantly, cheap.
While OpenAI had spent
hundreds of millions of dollars
training GPT-4, DeepSeek had allegedly created a competitive model for just
$6 million
. How? By using a technique called the
"mixture of experts" approach
, which allowed it to activate only the necessary parts of the AI during a task‚Äîsaving massive computational power.
‚úÖ
Pros of DeepSeek:
Unbelievably Cheap:
Created at a fraction of the cost of competitors.
Resource-Efficient:
Uses smart computing strategies to optimize AI tasks.
Open-Source Transparency:
Model weights were made public, allowing researchers to use and modify them.
But not everything was as it seemed.
‚ùå
Cons of DeepSeek:
Censored Responses:
Discussions about China‚Äôs politics, human rights, or controversial topics were strictly off-limits.
Data Privacy Risks:
Chinese AI firms are bound by strict government regulations, raising concerns about user data security.
The
real question was: what was China‚Äôs endgame?
Was DeepSeek just a technological advancement, or was it a strategic move in a bigger AI war?
Step 1 : Fork this repo to explore and enhance Ollama WebUI
GitHub - imvickykumar/Ollama-WebUI/fork
üöÄ
Step 2 : Go
to Codespaces
to set up your development environment.
How to Open in Codespaces:
Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click on the
‚ÄúCode‚Äù
button (green button at the top right).
Select the
‚ÄúCodespaces‚Äù
tab.
Click on
‚ÄúCreate Codespace on main‚Äù
to launch a new development environment.
Now, you can start coding directly in your browser with full access to the project! üöÄ
Step 3: Run the Server in Codespaces Terminal
Once you're inside
GitHub Codespaces
, open the terminal and navigate to the project directory (if not already there).
Run the following command to start the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
What Happens Next?
This command will start the Django server on
port 8000
.
GitHub Codespaces will detect the running service and provide a
public URL
to access your application.
Click on the provided URL to see your
Ollama WebUI
in action! üöÄ
Step 4: Install and Run Ollama in a New Terminal
In
GitHub Codespaces
, click on the
‚Äú+‚Äù
button in the terminal section.
Select
‚ÄúNew Terminal‚Äù
to open another shell instance.
Install Ollama
Run the following command to install Ollama:
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
Start the Ollama Server
Once the installation is complete, start the Ollama server by running:
ollama serve
üéØ
Next Steps:
Your AI model should now be running!
You can interact with the model directly in the terminal.
If integrating with the Django app, make sure the backend is set up to communicate with Ollama‚Äôs API.
üöÄ
You're now running Ollama inside Codespaces!
Ready to build something amazing? üòä
Step 5: Install and Configure Ngrok for Deployment
1. Install Ngrok via Apt
Run the following command in the
new terminal
to install
Ngrok
:
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
&& echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install ngrok
2. Add Your Ngrok Authentication Token
Once Ngrok is installed, configure it by adding your
auth token
:
ngrok config add-authtoken 2izwMxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqGi5h
(Replace the token with your actual Ngrok authtoken if different.)
3. Deploy Your App Online with Ngrok
Now, run Ngrok to expose your Django app to the internet:
ngrok http --url=free-camel-deadly.ngrok-free.app 8000
4. Visit Your Domain
Once Ngrok is running, it will provide a
public URL
that you can use to access your deployed app. Open your browser and visit:
https://free-camel-deadly.ngrok-free.app
üöÄ
Your Chatbot App is now live and accessible online!
üéâ
üîπ
Next Steps:
Test your chatbot online.
Share the link for feedback.
Ensure Ngrok is running continuously to keep your app accessible.
https://free-camel-deadly.ngrok-free.app/
‚ö†Ô∏è
Note:
If you are deploying your website using Ngrok, keep in mind that it will only remain accessible
as long as the terminal is active
.
Once the terminal is closed, the public URL will no longer be available. To keep your app live continuously, consider setting up a permanent deployment solution. üöÄ

comment section
if you need any modifications or troubleshooting! üòä

The AI revolution is no longer about who builds the smartest machines, but who controls their narrative. As DeepSeek challenges the West, Ollama decentralizes power, and NVIDIA falters‚Äîthis is not just a technological shift, but a geopolitical awakening. The future of AI will define the balance of power in the world.
